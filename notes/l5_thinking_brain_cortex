## Layered Structure of the cortex

- 6 layers arranged parallel to the surface. 
- Bsed on cellular typesand structures present 

1. Molecular layer
2. External granular layer
3. Exteral prymidial layer
4. Internal granular layer
5. Internal Pyrmidal layer
6. Multiform layer

### Sensory cortical columns are present across many senses and species 

### Thalamus is the cortical switchboard
- The thalaus has 3 seperate roles
  - Specific thalamic nuclei
    - Relay specific signals from ascending snensory pathwys to specific cortical areas arranged in sensory maps
  - Association thalamic nuclei
  - Non-specific thalamic nuclei
    - Attention regulation network


## The 'canonical' cortex circuit
- Cnonical cortex circuit = similar synaptic connections between layers in column are repeated throughout the cortex


# Cortical Asymmetry and language 

Structure and functional differences. There are also differances between people ie handedness. 

The hemispheres are roughly equal in size and shape, but they perform different functions.

The left hemisphere is responsible for language, logic, and analytical thinking. The right hemisphere is responsible for spatial perception, artistic and musical ability, and intuition.

The two hemispheres are structurally asymmetrical. The left hemisphere is larger than the right, and the two hemispheres have different shapes. The left hemisphere is more elongated, while the right hemisphere is more rounded.

The two hemispheres also have different patterns of activity. The left hemisphere is more active in tasks that involve language and logical thinking, while the right hemisphere is more active in tasks that involve spatial perception and intuition.


### Slit brain effects
- Split-brain studies revealed more subtle changes which helped clarify the lateralized functions of right and left hemispheres.
- Rapid presentation of visual information to either the right or left visual field with a tachistoscope results in lateralization of visual information about that object to the left or right hemisphere respectively. This is due to the contralateral projection of almost all sensory information arriving at the cerebral cortex
