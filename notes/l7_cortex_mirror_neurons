# The Mirror Neuron System

- Mirror neurons are cortical neurons that show activity
when
    - someone performs action AND
    - someone observes someone else perform similar action
- Mirror neurons may underlie capacity to
    - recognise actions and intentions of others
    - empathise with or imitate others
    - may be associated with evolution of language
- Disorders of mirror neuron system have been suggested to underlie autistic spectrum disorders

- Mirrror neurons are found in 
    - ventral premotor cortex and inferior parietal lobe
        - sensory 
    - inusla and rostral cingulate 
        - emotional into visceromotor emotional reponses
    - prefrontal cortex and language areas. 

## The action â€“ intention mirror neuron system
- Similar neurons were later found in inferior parietal lobule
    - many neurons only fired when coded motor act was followed by specific subsequent act
- The IPL brain area
    - does NOT directly control movements
    - DOES receive inputs from superior temporal sulcus, which detects biological movements but contains few mirror neurons
    - DOES produce outputs to premotor cortex

## Neuroanatomy of parieto-frontal mirror neuron system
- Three main areas contain mirror
neurons
    - Ventral premotor cortex (area F5)
    - area PFG (located between parietal areas PF and PG)
    - anterior intraparietal area (AIP)
- Parieto-frontal circuit receives highorder visual information from
    - superior temporal sulcus (STS)
    - inferior temporal lobe (IT)
- Parieto-frontal circuit controlled by
    - frontal lobe (area F6 or pre-supplementary motor area)
    - ventral prefrontal cortex (VPF)
- Enlarged view of area F5 shows
    - its sectors (F5a and F5p) buried inside arcuate sulcus
    - IAS, inferior limb of arcuate sulcus;
    - LIP, lateral intraparietal area
    - VIP, ventral intraparietal area
