## Cerebellum

The cerebellum is a region of the brain that is responsible for coordinating movement. It is located at the back of the brain, just above the brainstem. The cerebellum consists of two hemispheres, each of which is divided into three lobes. The lobes are separated by deep fissures. The cerebellum has a highly convoluted surface, which is covered by a thin layer of tissue called the cerebellar cortex. This cortex is responsible for processing information from the rest of the brain and body. The cerebellum also contains a number of deep nuclei, which are responsible for controlling movement.

It receives input from the motor cortex, the vestibular system, and proprioceptors.

## Thalmaus
- All sensory information to cortex comes through thalamus
- Collection of ~15 nuclei which process
  - Visual
  - Auditory
  - Somatosensory
  - Some motor information

- Thalamocortical loops reciprocally connected with cerebral cortex
- Primary relay thalamic nuclei receive cortical input from primary sensory cortex
- Higher order thalamic nuclei integrate sensory cortex output and project to association cortex

## Basal Ganglia
- Collection of subcortical nuclei deep in white matter
  - Caudate 
  - Putamen 
  - Globus pallidus
  - substantia nigra
  - subthalamic nucleus

- Important for 
    - Control of movement - smooth the transitions of muscle contractions 
    - learning and motivation

### Basal Ganglia and Movement
- Caudate and putamen receive excitatory inputs from motor cortex, thalamus and brainstem
- Many neurotransmitters in basal ganglia (GABA, domapine, Ach) but output from globus pallidus to thalamus is inhibitory 
- Brake hypothesis

## Hippocampus
- The hippocampus is a small, seahorse-shaped region of the brain that plays an important role in memory and navigation. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system, which is responsible for emotion and motivation. The hippocampus is thought to be one of the first areas of the brain to be affected by Alzheimer's disease.
- Part of the limbic system
- key area for formation of long-term memory
- Reciprocal connections to association cortices via medial temporal lobe

## Amygdala

- The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped structure located in the medial temporal lobe of the brain. It is part of the limbic system, which is involved in emotion and memory.

- The amygdala is involved in the processing of emotions such as fear and anxiety. It is also involved in the formation and storage of memories, especially those that are associated with emotional experiences.

- The amygdala is connected to the hippocampus, which is important for the consolidation of long-term memories. It is also connected to the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive functions such as decision-making and planning.

- The amygdala is activated in response to stressful or emotionally arousing situations. It is thought to play a role in the “fight-or-flight” response, which is the body’s natural response to perceived threats.

## Hypothalamus 
- The hypothalamus is a small, almond-shaped region of the brain that plays a critical role in regulating many important bodily functions. These include appetite, thirst, body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and hormone release. The hypothalamus is also involved in emotion and behavior.
