4. Development and plasticity of the samatosensory and its conections. 

## Trigeminal Pathways

The trigeminal nerve is the largest of the cranial nerves and is responsible for sensation in the face and motor function of the muscles of mastication (chewing). The trigeminal nerve has three main divisions: the ophthalmic nerve (V1), the maxillary nerve (V2), and the mandibular nerve (V3).

The ophthalmic nerve innervates the eye and surrounding structures. The maxillary nerve innervates the upper jaw and surrounding structures. The mandibular nerve innervates the lower jaw and surrounding structures.

The representation of these nerves is inverted in the brain stem. 

### Main Trigeminal Nucleus
The main trigeminal nucleus is a large, triangular-shaped nucleus located in the pons. It is the primary somatosensory nucleus for the face and head. It receives input from all three divisions of the trigeminal nerve (V1, V2, and V3). The main trigeminal nucleus is divided into four subnuclei: the principal, motor, interpolar, and spinal trigeminal nuclei. The principal trigeminal nucleus receives input from the V1 and V2 divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The motor trigeminal nucleus receives input from the V3 division of the trigeminal nerve. The interpolar trigeminal nucleus receives input from all three divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The spinal trigeminal nucleus receives input from the V3 division of the trigeminal nerve.

### Spinal Trigeminal Nucleus
The spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN) is a group of smaller neurons located in the brainstem. The STN is the primary source of input to the trigeminal nerve, which innervates the face and head. The STN is involved in the processing of pain, temperature, and touch sensations from the face and head.

The STN is divided into three main regions: the dorsal horn, the ventral horn, and the intermediate zone. The dorsal horn is responsible for processing pain and temperature sensations. The ventral horn is responsible for processing touch sensations. The intermediate zone is involved in the integration of information from the dorsal and ventral horns.

The STN receives input from a variety of sources, including the thalamus, the cerebral cortex, and the proprioceptive neurons in the muscles and joints of the head and neck. The STN also sends output to the thalamus, the cerebral cortex, and the muscles of the face and head.

### Mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus
Is the only primary sensory neuron in the brain. It projects to main and spinal trigeminal nuclei.

## Comparative Perspective of Somatotopy and Modularity with Mice

Somatotopy is the relationship between the body and the nervous system. It is the way in which the nervous system is organized to receive and process information from the body. Modularity is the way in which the nervous system is organized into distinct modules, or regions, that each have a specific function.

Most of these contections in the human brain are higher order, then their counter parts in other mamals. 

Looking at mice wiskers. The whiskers on the left side of the face are primarily represented in the left side of the brain, and those on the right side are primarily represented in the right side. However, the map is not mirror-symmetrical; instead, it is inversly projected to the brain in a way that reflects the actual layout of the whiskers on the face. For example, the whiskers in the center of the face are represented in the center of the brain, while those on the edge of the face are represented at the edge of the map.
