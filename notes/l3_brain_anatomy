# Basic Brain Anatomy

### Objectives
1. Desscribe and use anatomical terms
2. Name, find and describe major brain structures

## Overview

Roughly 100 billion neurons comprise the brain. These can be grouped into input, output and sensory. 

Transverse plane:
1. Cranial or rostal: toward the head 
2. Caudal: toward the tail

Frontal plan:
1. Dorsal: over 
2. Ventral: under

Grey = neurons. It contains neuron cell bodies and dendrites. 

White = axons. White matter connects one area of grey matter to another.

## Spinal Cord

~13 million neurons. It can be divided into two halfs: dorsal and ventral. All the sensory information comes in through dorsal roots. Ventral roots provide motor output for all the muscles at the respective level. Within the cord are white and and inner grey matter.

## Brain Stem 

Brain stem seamlessly conects with the spinal cord. It connects forebrain to spinal cord. White matter is outside with grey matter inside in descrete areas. Has three levels caudal to rostral:
1. Medulla oblongata
2. Pons 
3. Midbrain

### Medulla Oblongata
Worest place to get a brain injury. It contains areas that are important for head and neck movement. This is done through cranial motor neuron pools ie hyper glossal, vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. It also contains control centres for the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Furthermore, it is the main imput into the cerebellum which controls complex movement. 

### Pons
Latin for bridge. Is the bridge between medulla and midbrain. Contains areas important for head muscle control ( motor nuclia for a bunch of nerves), complex movement control (has tracks for lower body motor neurons), neuromodulation (has groups which release neurotransmitters). 

### Mid brain
- Eye movement
  - Superior collliculus
  - trachlear and oculomotor

- Sound processing
  - Inferior colliculus

-Body movements
    - red nucleus 
    - Internal capsule
    - substantia nigra
