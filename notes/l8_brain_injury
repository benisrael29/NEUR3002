# Brian Injury

Traumatic brain injury is a strutural injury which effects function. 

Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) - subjective scale of brain injury. Measure of verbal, and motor response inc eye. 

## Closed vs penetrating injuries to CNS

- Penetrating injuries distrupt the meninges and cause damage through physical entry.

- Closed injuries typiucally have meningeal coverings intact. 

### Alot of blood vessels in the arachnoid can be sheard be opposing forces during injury causing hematomas in injury specific regions.

If a small bleed occurs then over time the blood can start to pool and compress the tissue and later appear as a disfunction. Thus imaging to ensure there is no pooling or to initiate draining is best practice. 

## Diffuse Axonal Injury

Deformation of the tissue because of their viscoelastic properties and high degree of alignment in tracts. Microglial activation is an indicator inflamatory response and thus shearing. 

Coup-Countercoup injury - is the injury in opposite and frontal as brain rebounds to back of scull. Frontal cortex and temporal polar cortex are particulary vulnerable.

## Residual Effects of TBI
1. Cognitive impairment
2. Seizure disorder
3. Mood disorder
4. Behavioural problems
5. Personality changes
6. PTSD 

## Problems

- Clinicians cant predict what patients will continue to have ill effects from their injury 
- No treatment options available for people with TBI 
    - Management of intracranial pressure often poor. 
    - Treatment not nationally consistent 
    - Clinical trials often small scale
