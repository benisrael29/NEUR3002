# The classical connectionist model of language processing

### Broca's aphasia- damage to Broca's area in left frontal lobe
- Marked difficulty in producing coherent speech - “telegraphic”
speech
- Speech comprehension is relatively intact
- Not due to motor impairment
- Patient is conscious of difficulties with language
### Wernicke’s aphasia - damage to Wernicke’s area in posterior region of superior temporal gyrus
- Marked difficulty in comprehending speech. Speech is fluent,
but disjointed to completely meaningless.
- Patient is often unconscious of difficulties with language
comprehension and expression.
### Conduction aphasia - damage to arcuate fasiculus, connecting Wernicke’s area to Broca’s area
- Characterized by inability to repeat aloud what has been heard.
- Speech is fluent, but disjointed to completely meaningless, as
for Wernicke’s.
- Comprehension of speech and written language largely intact,
as for Brocas’s
