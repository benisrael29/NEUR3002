## Pre-clinical studies into traumatic injury
- How to induce brain injury in animal models? and How do we measure it?

Testing for brain injury
- Neurological scoring 
- Motor/sensory performance
    - Tapered beam 
- Learning and memory 
    - Active place avoidance task
    - Morris water maze
    - Y-maze

## Types of behavioural tests

### Working memory and referance memory with spatial component 
- Water maze
- Barnes maze
- Y-maze

### Exploratory behaviour
- Open field (large/small/round/sqaure)

### Motor function
- beam walking
- rotarod 
- staircase

### Anxiety related behaviour and emotion
- elevated plus maze
- zero maze

Also tests for associative learning and memory, socia. interaction and cognition. 


## Open Field test
- Comprises of a chamber that has lasers which track the position and motion of the mouse. 
- The output of the apperatus is a map of the path the mouse takes. 
- If it is anxious it spends more time in the corners. If it is confident it moves toward the centre. Thus you can measure exploritory behaviour. 


## Morris Water Maze 
- Spatial learning and memory task where mouse tries to find the lendge in a small pool. 
- The reward is taking the mouse out and drying it. 
- Measure time/latency until the mouse reaches the platform. 

## Y-maze
- 3 min training, 20 min break, 3 min test
- Maze is set up as a Y 

## Important considerations for behavioural testing
- often multiple tests required to demonstrate a particular deficit
- handling of mice (to reduce anxiety)
- blinded experiments - alternate between groups
- test same animal on multiple tests
- group size n>10 
- Single housing vs group housing
- circadian rhythms

## Controlled Cortical Impact
- Method for inducing traumatic brain injury
- Involes controlled cortical impact, moderate unilateral injury
- High reporducibility, shame controls

## Active palce avoidance test
- Mouse has to avoid a shock from a region of a rotating plate.
